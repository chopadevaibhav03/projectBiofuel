# BioFuel Supply Chain System

## Overview

The BioFuel Supply Chain System is an innovative project developed as part of a group initiative at Symbiosis Digital Academy, Pune. The primary objective of the system is to manage the end-to-end process of transforming raw materials sourced from farmers into biofuel and distributing it to the market. This project focuses on streamlining product management, order processing, and ensuring that the supply chain operates in a cost-effective and eco-friendly manner.

This project integrates a full-stack approach, using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Angular** for the backend and frontend development, with **SQL** as the database management system. The system was thoroughly tested using **Postman** and deployed on **Tomcat Server** to ensure that data transactions and functionalities were working as expected.

## Key Features

- **Raw Material Management**: Efficiently manage raw materials sourced from farmers for biofuel production.
- **Product Management**: Oversee the processing of raw materials into biofuel, including adding, updating, and deleting product records in the system.
- **Order Processing**: Streamlined the process of distributing biofuel to the market through effective order management.
- **Cost-Effective & Eco-Friendly**: The project emphasizes eco-friendly practices, contributing to a sustainable future by promoting biofuel usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Angular, Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQL
- **Testing & Deployment**: Postman, Tomcat Server

## Project Contributions

This was a collaborative project, where my primary contributions included:

- **Backend Development**: Worked extensively on building the backend using Java and Spring Boot. Focused on implementing business logic, data handling, and integration with the database.
- **Frontend Development**: Contributed to specific frontend modules using Angular and Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Testing**: Utilized Postman for API testing to verify data passing and functionality, ensuring seamless integration between the frontend and backend.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:

- **XML Dependency Injection**: Learned how to efficiently manage dependencies in Spring Boot using XML configurations.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Acquired practical experience in integrating frontend and backend technologies in a real-time project environment.
- **Team Collaboration**: Developed skills in collaborating with a team to achieve project goals while managing different aspects of the development process.

## Challenges & Improvements

Although the frontend design was well-executed, some of the backend functionalities had limitations. Despite this, the project provided an excellent opportunity to understand the complexities of full-stack development and to contribute to a meaningful, sustainable initiative.
